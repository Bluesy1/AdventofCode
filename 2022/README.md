# Advent Of Code 2022

There are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). I have implemented them all in Kotlin
using openjdk-19. In this repo I have all the questions and inputs included in the inputs folder for each day as well
as my solutions for each day in.

To use the bash script to auto create the files for the day, you will need to have [curl](https://curl.se/) installed, and have your session token for advent of code in the `AOC_COOKIE` environment variable.
